>**Skills Utilized**:
<ol>
    <li>Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
    <li>Asynchronous Functions</li>
    <li>API Fetch</li>
    <li>DOM Manipulation</li>
    <li>Objects and Arrays</li>

## About
This was developed during Bootcamp Week 6 and uses data from the [Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority](https://www.mbta.com/) (MBTA) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) APIs to show real-time bus locations.

>**Assignment Objectives**:
<ol>
    <li>Generate a map data from the Mapbox API</li>
    <li>Fetch data from the MBTA public API</li>
    <li>Create map markers based on real time bus locations</li>
    <li>Map markers positions should update as real-time locations change</li>
</ol>

>**Custom Features**:
<ol>
    <li>Color coded map markers</li>
    <li>Color coded 'bus lines' list</li>
    <li>Last updated timestamp</li>
    <li>Refresh countdown timer</li>
    <li>Light / dark mode toggle button</li>
    <li>Button and map control hover effects</li>
    <li>Run button status change to 'Live'</li>
    <li>'OEM' button styling</li>
</ol>

## How to Run
> Mode Button

Change the map to 'light' mode (streets-v11) or back to 'dark' mode (dark-v10).

> Run Button

Fetch MBTA API data and create bus markers on the map. Once clicked, button is disabled and button text changes to 'Live'.  API data is refreshed every 10s. 

> Map Controls

Notes:  See [https://docs.mapbox.com/](https://docs.mapbox.com/) for mapbox documentation.
## Future Roadmap
- [x] Different marker colors for each bus
- [x] Include update/refresh data on map
- [x] Add light / dark mode toggle
- [x] Make buttons look 'OEM' and responsive
- [x] Mobile compatible
- [x] Add color coded 'bus lines' list

This is a progression project, no further development is anticipated.
